            <h2> What is alcohol fermentation? </h2>
            <p> Alcohol fermentation is a biological process in which yeast or other microorganisms convert sugars, such as glucose or sucrose, into ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide. It is one of the most well-known forms of fermentation, used in the production of alcoholic beverages and in various industries. </p>

            <h2> How does it work? </h2>
            <p> Alcohol fermentation is a process where enzymes in yeast break down sugars into simpler molecules. These molecules are then converted into ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide. In the process, energy is released, allowing the yeast to survive in such harsh conditions. </p>
