            <h2> What is acetic fermentation? </h2>
            <p> Acetic fermentation is a biological process in which bacteria convert ethyl alcohol into acetic acid using atmospheric oxygen. It is the process responsible for the production of food-grade vinegar, such as wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar. Acetic fermentation is widely used in the food and culinary industry. </p>

            <h2> How does it work? </h2>
            <p> Acetic fermentation occurs in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. The bacteria utilize enzymes to oxidize ethyl alcohol, converting it into acetic acid. This process relies on the availability of oxygen and takes place under specific conditions, such as fermenters equipped with surfaces exposed to air. </p>

            <h2> Applications of acetic fermentation </h2>
            <p> Acetic fermentation has various practical applications. It is used in the production of food-grade vinegar, which is a popular addition to salads, marinades, and sauces. Wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar, which are produced through acetic fermentation, are also utilized in food preservation. Additionally, acetic fermentation plays a significant role in the chemical industry, where acetic acid is used as a raw material for the production of solvents, dyes, and plastics. </p>
