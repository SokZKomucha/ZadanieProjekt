            <h2> What is lactic fermentation? </h2>
            <p> Lactic fermentation is a biological process in which lactic acid bacteria, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i>, convert sugars, primarily lactose, into lactic acid. It is widely used in the production of yogurt, kefir, cheese, and other dairy products. </p>

            <h2> How does it work? </h2>
            <p> Lactic fermentation occurs in oxygenless environments. Lactic acid bacteria utilize enzymes to transform sugars present in milk, such as lactose, into lactic acid. This process is significant both for food preservation purposes and for creating the characteristic flavor and texture of dairy products. </p>

            <h2> Applications of lactic fermentation </h2>
            <p> Lactic fermentation has broad applications in the food industry. It is used in the production of yogurt, kefir, cheese, buttermilk, and other dairy products. The lactic acid bacteria involved in lactic fermentation also have beneficial effects on health as they introduce beneficial bacteria to the digestive tract. </p>
